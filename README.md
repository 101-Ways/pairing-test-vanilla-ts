## 101 pair coding blank canvas
A lightweight bare bones, vanilla, 💀 🍦  TypeScript playground.

Run ``` yarn build:watch``` whilst making changes.
Run ``` yarn test``` to run Jest tests.

This is bare-bones, no dependencies (other than dev dependencies to build it), no framework, so no dev server, just open ```public/index.html``` in a browser and refresh when you make changes.
